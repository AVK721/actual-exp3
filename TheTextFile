Three for the elven kings, under the sky.
Seven for the dwarf lords, in their hall of stone.
Nine for the mortal men, doomed to die.
One for the dark lord in his dark throne, in the land of mordor where the shadows lie.

One ring to rule them all. 
One ring to find them. 
One ring to bring them all and in darkness bind them. 
In the land of mordor, where the shadows lie.
